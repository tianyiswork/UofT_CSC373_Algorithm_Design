# UofT CSC373 Algorithm Design
Course Description (from course website):

Standard algorithm design techniques: divide-and-conquer, greedy strategies, dynamic programming, linear programming, randomization, network flows, approximation algorithms. Brief introduction to NP-completeness: polynomial time reductions, examples of various NP-complete problems, self-reducibility. Students will be expected to show good design principles and reasonable skill at reasoning about the correctness and complexity of algorithms.
